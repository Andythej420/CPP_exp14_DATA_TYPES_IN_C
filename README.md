# C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

## AIM
To study and implement **C++ Program Structure** with a focus on **Data Types**.

---

## SOFTWARE USED
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

---

## Theory
This program demonstrates the **basic structure** and usage of **built-in data types** in C++ by showing:

- Variable **declaration**, **initialization**, and **output** using `cout`.  
- Use of fundamental data types:
  - `int` → stores integers  
  - `float` → stores single-precision decimal numbers  
  - `double` → stores double-precision decimal numbers  
  - `char` → stores a single character  
  - `bool` → stores Boolean values (`true` or `false`)  
- Usage of the `sizeof` operator to determine and display the **memory size (in bytes)** of each data type.  

This helps in understanding how data is stored and managed in memory and provides a foundation for C++ programming.

## Algorithm
1. Start the program.  
2. Declare variables of different data types (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`).  
3. Assign values to each variable.  
4. Print the values and their memory sizes using `cout` and `sizeof()`.  
5. End the program.
